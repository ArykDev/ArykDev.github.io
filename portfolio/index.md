# Portfolio

My name is Jack Eilles, I am a student at New College Durham currently studying [T-Level Digital Production, Design, and Development](https://qualifications.pearson.com/en/qualifications/t-levels/digital-production-design-and-development.html), and will complete this course in the Summer of 2024.

I am a Student Member of the British Computing Society (BCS) and I'm also completing an Introductory Python Course on [Cisco NetAcademy](https://netacad.com "Cisco NetAcademy Website") which I am expected to hold a certification in the next few weeks.

### Experience

I have had a large interest in computers from a young age, which has helped attribute to a large amount of experience gained, most in the last few years.

| Experience                 |   Time    |

| Linux Desktop              | 5 years   |
| Linux Terminal (ZSH/BASH)  | 4 years   |
| Python 3                   | 4 years   |
| HTML/CSS                   | 2 years   |
| Proxmox                    | 5 Months  |

There is likely much more unmentioned experience, however these are the ones I can think of off the top of my head.
If any more is needed then I will most likely remember if I'm asked.

### Maintained Projects

Currently, I am only maintaining a program which I have written known as 'KExUtil' which is used to assist people in the use of the `kexec` command in Linux.

Extra writing on this project can be found in [this blog post](https://arykdev.wordpress.com/2022/11/19/kexutil/ "KExUtil Blog Post on arykdev.wordpress.com").
