This section of the site is dedicated to a discord bot I wrote known as SPCVerif, used to verify music producers as they enter a server known as the Small Producer Community.

### About the Bot

The bot utilises the discord.py module to handle calls to the Discord bot API, it takes a command with a users producer profile in as an argument, then sends the link to a seperate (private) channel for the moderators to look over before allowing a user entry to the server.
