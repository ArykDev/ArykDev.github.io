# Welcome to arykdev.github.io!

### About Me
My name is Jack Eilles, I am a T-Level DPDD Student at New College Durham with experience in Proxmox, Python 3, Linux Servers, and much [more](portfolio.md).
This website will contain all of my current projects, as well as ongoing projects, along with some guides as well.

Currently, my main programming language is Python 3, however I would like to work on learning others in the future, like C++, Java, etc...
I also have experience in HTML and CSS, and I'm currently working on understanding Javascript.

### Current Projects

Recently, I have been working on a terminal utility for the command `kexec`, to assist in helping people use it without needing to type in a massive command.
Currently the program is quite limited, only being able to reboot the currently running kernel, however I am figuring out how to detect every kernel installed and add a selection menu.
